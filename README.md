## Lessons Learned

This was our course project for a course in our 2nd Year, We started the project with no prior knowledge in any of the languages or technologies used. We had some difficulty in finalizing the languages needed for the website.
There are many languages and we needed some time to decide on the server side scripts we are going to use. But the experience was very new and when the website was finally built, we felt that our efforts were not wasted. The overall experience of making our first Web Development was amazing and we had the urge to optimize the website even more.
